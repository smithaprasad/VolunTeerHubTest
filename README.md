*A ground-breaking innovative Project done and designed by Adya and Sahana!!!*

# Volunteer App

## Overview

Welcome to VolunteerHub! This platform is created for teens, by teens (but is open to anyone) for everyone who wants to make a positive impact through volunteering, or is just looking for something to do, perhaps even to *meet certain requirements* (N(J)HS, Sponsored Hours, Volunteering Requirements, etc.)! Our firsthand experiences with various volunteering opportunities have inspired us to develop an improved application that goes beyond what's already out there. Our goal is to make volunteering more accessible, engaging, and rewarding for everyone!!!

## Purpose

Our Volunteer App aims to connect volunteers with meaningful opportunities, making it easier to find, track, and enjoy volunteering experiences. We believe that volunteering should be a fulfilling and motivating activity, and that is exactly what we've set out and aim to do and make possible: our app is designed to support and enhance _your journey_ as a volunteer.
