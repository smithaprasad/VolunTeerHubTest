# VolunteerHub
### A ground-breaking innovative Project done and designed by Adya and Sahana!!!

## Overview
Welcome to VolunteerHub! This platform is created for teens, by teens (but is open to anyone) for everyone who wants to make a positive impact through volunteering, or is just looking for something to do, perhaps even to meet certain requirements (N(J)HS, Sponsored Hours, Volunteering Requirements, etc.)! Our firsthand experiences with various volunteering opportunities have inspired us to develop an improved application that goes beyond what's already out there. Our goal is to make volunteering more accessible, engaging, and rewarding for everyone!!!

## Purpose
Our Volunteer App aims to connect volunteers with meaningful opportunities, making it easier to find, track, and enjoy volunteering experiences. We believe that volunteering should be a fulfilling and motivating activity, and that is exactly what we've set out and aim to do and make possible: our app is designed to support and enhance your journey as a volunteer.

## Goals
Our primary goal is to create a supportive and engaging platform that encourages more people to volunteer and make a difference. We want to:
- Make volunteering more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
- Provide a comprehensive and user-friendly tool for tracking and managing volunteering activities.
- Foster a sense of community and motivation among volunteers through fun and rewarding features.

## Development Process

### Front-End Development
We started by creating the entire front-end of the Volunteering Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The front-end includes features such as personalized profiles, logging and tracking volunteer hours, discovering opportunities, and checking eligibility for various awards and achievements. We also implemented fun aspects like points, goals, and achievements to keep users motivated.

### Back-End Development
For the back-end, we used SQL to create and manage our database. The database includes tables for users, volunteer opportunities, matches, and sessions for user authentication. Here's a brief overview of the SQL code:

```sql
-- Create Users table
CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    skills TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create Opportunities table
CREATE TABLE Opportunities (
    opportunity_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    required_skills TEXT,
    location VARCHAR(100),
    experience_level VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create Matches table
CREATE TABLE Matches (
    match_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    opportunity_id INT,
    matched_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (opportunity_id) REFERENCES Opportunities(opportunity_id)
);

-- Create Sessions table for user authentication
CREATE TABLE Sessions (
    session_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    session_token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);
```

### Web-Scraping
To develop the "matching" feature, we used Python for web-scraping. This allows us to gather volunteer opportunities from various sources and match them with users based on their preferences and skills. Here's a version of our web-scraping code:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

def scrape_opportunities(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print(f"Failed to retrieve data from {url}")
        return pd.DataFrame()
    
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    opportunities = []
    for item in soup.find_all('div', class_='opportunity'):
        title = item.find('h2').text.strip()
        description = item.find('p').text.strip()
        required_skills = item.find('span', class_='skills').text.strip()
        opportunities.append({
            'title': title,
            'description': description,
            'required_skills': required_skills
        })
    
    return pd.DataFrame(opportunities)

url = 'https://example.com/volunteer-opportunities'
df = scrape_opportunities(url)
df.to_csv('opportunities.csv', index=False)
print("Scraping completed and data saved to opportunities.csv")
```

## How It Works

### User Registration and Login
Users can create an account by providing their username, password, email, and other details. Once registered, they can log in to access their personalized profile.

### Personalized Profile
Users can customize their profile by adding their skills, interests, and achievements. This helps in matching them with suitable volunteer opportunities.

### Logging and Tracking Hours
Users can log their volunteer hours and track their progress over time. This feature helps them see the impact of their volunteering efforts.

### Discovering Opportunities
Users can search for volunteer opportunities based on location, experience level, and categories of interest. The app uses the data gathered from web-scraping to provide a wide range of opportunities.

### Matching Algorithm
The app uses a matching algorithm to connect users with opportunities that match their skills and interests. This ensures that users find meaningful and relevant opportunities.

### Fun and Motivating Aspects
To keep users engaged, the app includes gamification elements such as points, goals, and achievements. Users can earn points for logging hours, completing opportunities, and reaching milestones.

## Why It's Useful
The Volunteer App is designed to make volunteering more accessible and enjoyable for everyone, especially teenagers. Here are some key benefits:
- **Personalized Experience**: Users can find opportunities that match their interests and skills.
- **Easy Tracking**: Users can log and track their volunteer hours effortlessly.
- **Motivating Features**: Gamification elements keep users motivated and engaged.
- **Comprehensive Database**: The app provides a wide range of opportunities gathered through web-scraping.
- **Community Building**: Users can connect with like-minded individuals and organizations.

## Conclusion
Our Volunteer App is a comprehensive platform that makes volunteering easy, fun, and rewarding. By integrating front-end and back-end technologies, along with web-scraping, we have created a robust and user-friendly application. We hope this app will inspire more teenagers to get involved in volunteering and make a positive impact in their communities.
